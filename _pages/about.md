You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

A data-driven personal website
======
Welcome to my personal website! I am Kunchen Xie, a senior undergraduate student majoring in chemistry at Zhengzhou University (ZZU).In September this year (2023), I will go to Peking University for my master's degree. If you have any suggestions for website construction or scientific research, please feel free to send me an email [(xkc@stu.zzu.edu.cn)].
